Implementation Plan: Multi-Platform Expansion
This plan outlines the strategy to expand the Scrapper Bot to include quick commerce (Zepto, Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart) and food delivery (Zomato, Swiggy Food) platforms.

Phase 1: Architectural Refactoring & Generalization
Objective: To adapt the backend and data models to support different types of deals.

Step 1.1: Create a New Data Model for Food Deals

File: backend/models/foodDealModel.js (New File)

Action: Create a new Mongoose schema for food deals with fields like dishName, restaurantName, rating, price, platform, etc.

Step 1.2: Create New API Routes for Food Deals

File: backend/routes/foodDealRoute.js (New File)

Action: Create a new Express router to handle API requests for food deals (e.g., GET /api/foodDeals).

File: backend/server.js

Action: Import and use the new foodDealRouter as /api/foodDeals.

Step 1.3: Differentiate Scraper Types

File: backend/utils/scraperUtil.js (Renaming helpers.js)

Action: Modify the URL generation logic to handle different search categories (products, cuisines) and associate them with specific scrapers.

Step 1.4: Update the Frontend for New Categories

File: frontend/src/App.jsx

Action: Add a new route /food-deals for the food deals page.

File: frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx

Action: Add a "Food Deals" link to the navigation bar.

File: frontend/src/pages/FoodDealsPage.jsx (New File)

Action: Create a new page component to display the scraped food deals.

Phase 2: Implement Quick Commerce Scrapers (Zepto, Blinkit, Instamart)
Objective: To add new quick commerce platforms, which will use the existing product data model.

Step 2.1: Research Scraping Methods

Action: Investigate each platform (starting with Zepto) to determine the best scraping strategy (API vs. Puppeteer).

Step 2.2: Implement the First Quick Commerce Scraper

File: backend/scrapers/zeptoScraper.js (New File)

Action: Create the new scraper, including logic for location handling. Save data to the existing Product model.

Step 2.3: Integrate the New Scraper

File: backend/routes/scrapeRoute.js & backend/server.js

Action: Add the scrapeZepto function to the scraping triggers.

File: frontend/src/pages/HomePage.jsx

Action: Add a "Scrape Zepto" button.

Step 2.4: Repeat for Other Platforms

Action: Once Zepto is stable, repeat the process for Blinkit and Swiggy Instamart, creating blinkitScraper.js and swiggyInstamartScraper.js respectively.

Phase 3: Implement Food Delivery Scrapers (Zomato, Swiggy Food)
Objective: To add food delivery platforms using the new food data model.

Step 3.1: Research Scraping Methods

Action: Investigate Zomato and Swiggy for the most reliable scraping approach.

Step 3.2: Implement the First Food Scraper

File: backend/scrapers/zomatoScraper.js (New File)

Action: Create the new scraper. It will need to handle address setting, search for restaurants/dishes, and save the data to the foodDealModel.js collection.

Step 3.3: Integrate and Display the Data

File: backend/routes/scrapeRoute.js & backend/server.js

Action: Add the scrapeZomato function to the triggers.

File: frontend/src/pages/HomePage.jsx

Action: Add a "Scrape Zomato" button.

File: frontend/src/hooks/useFoodDeals.js (New File)

Action: Create a new React Query hook to fetch data from /api/foodDeals.

File: frontend/src/pages/FoodDealsPage.jsx

Action: Use the new hook to display the Zomato deals.

Step 3.4: Repeat for Swiggy Food

Action: Once Zomato is complete, replicate the process for Swiggy Food, creating swiggyFoodScraper.js.
